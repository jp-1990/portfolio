## Summary

This site is my portfolio, and as such, is designed to showcase my skills and projects in a streamlined and accessible way. In order to make future content updates as easy as possible I chose to use Gatsby with GraphQL, linked to Contentful as my CMS.

## What I learned

This project was the first time I used Gatsby, GraphQL or Contentful. With previous React experience I found it very easy to pick up, with the GraphQL implementation being very straight forward. Gatsby definitely has more to offer than the static site I used it for here, but it is certainly effective for such a use case. The ease of passing data into the site, and providing content updates, with GraphQL and Contentful offers real business value in terms of speed and efficiency.

CSS frameworks are popular in static sites at the time of writing, however I chose to increase my understanding of custom CSS using Sass for this project. As I intended to use this site as my portfolio, I decided it would be an ideal time to further investigate CSS animations. In the end I decided on 3D animations of a 180 degree rotating card, and a an infinitely spinning dodecahedron, amongst other more basic transitions.
